My friend [Danish](https://danishpraka.sh/posts/blog-questions-challenge/) tagged me in this “blog challenge”, and here are my answers:

**Why did you start blogging in the first place?**
Ever since I was in school, I've been good at writing, so when I discovered blogging, it seemed like a good creative outlet. Later, I studied to be a software engineer and liked front-end development, and a lot of developers had their own blogs, so blogging then became an experimentation ground for polishing my front-end skills as well.

**What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?**
The current version of the blog ( as of 20 March 2025 ) is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). I used my own base [template](https://github.com/arpitbatra123/eleventy-blog-mnml) as a starting point. I started with WordPress but found it too cumbersome for my tiny use case of hosting some words with a minimal design.

**How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?**
It’s all over the place honestly. For example, this post is currently being written in Notion. I did not use it much earlier, but my current org uses Notion and I’ve started liking it as well. Most blog posts start in some kind of note-taking tool ( Apple Notes, Simplenote etc.) and I write some of them directly as a Markdown file in the source code directly on VS Code  as well.

**When do you feel most inspired to write?**

Inspiration comes and goes ( takes a long time to come back after going ) . I wish I could rely on discipline rather than inspiration, especially for writing technical posts but it is what is is. Some of the posts on my blog however, have been written like as soon as the thought came to my mind, and I like those best.

**Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?**
Some of the posts have been published an year after they were written, because I could not be arsed to edit them. Some of them have been published immediately with grave spelling errors.

**What's your favorite post on your blog?**
I really like this [one](https://arpit.tk/posts/where-are-we-coming-from-where-will-we-go/) . It might not mean much to somebody else reading it, but it means a lot to me. I’m particularly proud of the poem I’ve written there.

**Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?**

If I had a dollar for every time I’ve redesigned my blog instead of doing actual writing! I don’t want to move to another platform, I like the simplicity of 11ty very much. A lot of feature additions are pending though, I gotta add a projects page listing some of my side projects. 


**Who's next?**
You?
